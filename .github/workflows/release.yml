# Release workflow.
# It runs two jobs
#  - build job which builds zephyr on: linux, macos and windows and uploads
#    artifacts using `action/upload-artifact`.
#  - release job which depends on completion of the previous job:
#     * creata a new release using `actions/create-release`
#     * downloads artifacts using `action/download-artifact`.
#     * uploads artifacts to the release with `action/upload-release-asset`
#    The last two actions are done for all three systems.
